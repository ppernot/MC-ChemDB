2023-03-27 :
        * New v1.4
        * Add photolysis of sulfur compounds: H2S, CH3SH, S, SO2, OCS, SO, SC2
        * Add misc. additional compounds: C2, CH, CH3CN, CH3OH, CN, H2CO, HC3N,
          NH2, NO2, O3, OH, SO

2022-03-24 :
        * Added H2O2 and O2

2021-05-04 : 
	* New v1.2
 	* Corrected inversion of CH4 channels 1 and 2 (CH3 and 1CH2)
	  (found by E. HÃ©brard)

2109-12-18 :
	* Corrected problem with numbering of CH4 channels
    * Added CO2; Assigned 3CO to CO (Channel 7)

2019-07-31 : 
	* New v1.1
 	  + changed structure : cohabitation of 1nm and 0.1nm resolutions
	  + separated data from fixed resolution generated data
      + generative model enables choice between Leiden and SWRI XS
      + in absence of BR in Leiden DB, SWRI ones are used by default
        except for CH4 (taken from Plessis et al.)

2019-07-31 : 
	* Added Leiden cross-sections 

2019-04-10 : 
	* Added H2O

2019-03-14 : 
	* Restored data for C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and HCN from SWRI (Ionic channels were strange...) 

2019-03-14 : 
	* Added CO ; Assigned C1D to dummy CxHyNz
